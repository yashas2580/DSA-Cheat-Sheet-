<h1>Stacks in C++</h1>
<h2>Important points in stacks </h2>
<p> Stack is a type of data structure that follows LIFO order. Last in First Out</p>
<h2>Creation of Stack using Stl</h2>
<p>Stack can be created using the following command <code> <b>stack < int> s; </b> </code></p>
<h3>Basic Operations in Stacks</h3>
<p> <b>Push operation:-</b> This operation helps us to add an elemenet to the stack . <br> Example:- Consider a stack of name "s". Here we can push an element using the syntax <br>"<b>  s.push(element);     </b>"</b></p>
<p><b>Pop operation:-</b> This operation helps us to remove last element from the stack. <br> Example:- Consider a stack of name "s" . Here we can pop an element by using the syntax <br> "<b>s.pop(element);"</b></p>
<p> <b>Top operation:-</b> As stacks follows lifo order by using the operation we can see the top element of the stack.<br> Example:- Consider a stack of name "s". We can see the top element using the syntax <b>"s.top();" </b></p>
<p><b>Empty operation:-</b> When we just want to check that if the stack is empty or is filled. We can use the operation known as Emprty opeartion it return the answer in boolean.<br> Example:- Consider a stack of name s if we use the command or code <b>"s.empty()"</b> we can check either the stack is empty or filled.</p>
